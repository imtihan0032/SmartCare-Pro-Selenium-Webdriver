## Getting Started

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: folder contains the automation script file 'TestScript.Java', dataset called 'Sample Dataset'.csv and the web driver 'chromedriver.exe'.
- `lib`: folder contains the dependencies, and jar files for Selenium 4.18.1.

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Steps for Script Execution

- Install Selenium version 4.18.1.
- Ensure the test environment is set up correctly (Google Chrome Version 123.0.6312.58 and ChromeDriver Version 123).
- Open the project in a text editor or IDE.
- Verify that all necessary imports and dependencies are correctly included.
- Run the test script (TestScript.java) using your text editor or IDE.
- Monitor the browser to see the automated actions being performed.
